# Clinic Managemen System
A project that i created for one of my modules in my CS degree. Web based application to manage a clinc. Basic functionalities are embedded into the system. Patient registering, prognosis and diagnosis of the patient and patient history. Full application is coded in PHP.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo.
There will be two folders inside. Backend and Client.
All the modules has to be installed before the application can be used.

### Installing and running

You will need a xampp or wamp to run the application.

After that move clone the repo the htdocs folder and run the server.

Enter the localhost:port to view the application.
For the database(MongoDB), you can create a database link using MLAB and connect to the cloud or use local database.
Adjust the enivronment variables according to your system, so that frontend can communicate with the backend.

Database is not included in the application. It's my regret to announce that since this is a very old project database file is lost in transition.
